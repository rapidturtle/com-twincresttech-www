        Twincrest Technologies was formed in May 2008 as the distributor for
        Wavetronix within the state of Texas. Since then, the company has grown
        in employees and territory as well as product lines offered. We now
        cover Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi; and are proud to have formed
        solid relationships with companies that are proven leaders in their
        respective markets. Twincrest Technologies desires to be the leading
        distributor of traffic control products within our market. This begins
        with quality service for each and every customer we have. Whether you
        are purchasing one sensor or one thousand, our goal is to provide you
        the products you need, when you need them, and with responsiveness that
        cannot be matched.
